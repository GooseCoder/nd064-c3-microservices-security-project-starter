2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   On 2022-01-01 14:04:12 an attacker successfully gained privileged access to the cluster 
   and was able to launch 3 privileged pods each one running cryptocurrency mining software. 
   Those pods were running unrestricted access to the cluster and were draining cpu, memory 
   and storage resources that impacted perfomance of other services

3. Summary of what was affected: 
   The affected parts were mainly the GPU resources, since those were used to mine cryptocurrency.

4. Summmary of the impact: 
   Unregistered pods were launched, 3 to be exact, that were mining cryptocurrency, performance was impacted.

5. Summary of the remediation steps: .
   The pods were forcefully removed a research task was created to investigate the attack vector

6. Summary of lessons learned: 
   The Kubernetes cluster should be hardened to patch access to the kube-server api service, 
   the cluster should be able to create pods from allowed images only, this should be fixed as well.
