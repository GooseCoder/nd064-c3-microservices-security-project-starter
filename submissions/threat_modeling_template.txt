# Docker STRIDE 

1. Tampering - Attacker gains access to the client. This leads to unwanted modifications of the Dockerfile used to build the image, this could propagate malware to other users of the image.
2. Spoofing - Client traffic from the Docker client to the  daemon or registry could be spoofed by an attacker. 
3. Information Disclosure - An Attacker may expose sensitive information such as secrets that could impact the security of the cluster and end users.
4. Elevation of Privilege - A Container image can be modified to run with the --privileged flag, this escalation of privileges could enable the access to other admin resources or the kube-api-server itself.
5. Denial of Service - An Attacker can redirect Excessive traffic to the client and overload the daemon or increment the resource usage that can lead to a system crash or worse increased cloud resource allocation costs.

# k8s  STRIDE 

1. Tampering - The configuration of etcd may be tampered with by an attacker, modifying system-level configurations such as pod specs.
2. Spoofing - These are man in the middle attacks caused by configuration mismatch when the apiserver cannot verify kubelets ssl certificates.
3. Information Disclosure - Sensitive information may be exposed via the etcd key-value store which can be used to make unwanted request and access data. 
4. Elevation of Privilege - privilege can be gained by using the privileged flag while spanning the containers/pods.
5. Denial of Service - Attackers can redirect Excessive traffic causing the cluster to overload and be unable to process legitimate requests.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that 
you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At 
least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the 
exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).

*1.2.3 You should add rules for the Docker daemon.
*1.2.4 You should add a rule for the /var/lib/docker directory.
*1.2.5 You should add a rule for the /etc/docker directory.
*1.2.6 If the file exists, a rule for it should be added.
*1.2.7 Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
